**PNC Insurance Data Analysis**

**Overview**
This project analyzes a sample dataset of PNC (Property and Casualty) insurance policies to identify trends in policy renewals and determine the best line of business for brokers and producers. The analysis focuses on customer retention, renewal rates, and key factors influencing policy continuation.

**Key Questions Addressed**
1. What is the policy renewal rate?
2. Which factors influence policy renewal?
3. Which line of business has the highest renewal rate?
4. What is the best line of business for brokers and producers?
5. How do customer demographics impact renewal?

**Analysis Highlights**
- Renewal Rate: Calculated the overall renewal rate and segmented it by policy type, income level, and marital status.
- Key Drivers of Renewal: Identified customer satisfaction, engagement, and discounts as critical factors influencing renewal decisions.
- Best Line of Business: Determined that `Comprehensive` policies have the highest renewal rate and profitability.
- Visual Insights: Generated box plots, bar charts, and correlation matrices to visualize trends and relationships.

**Key Findings**
1. Renewal Rate: The overall renewal rate is **70%**, with variations across policy types and customer segments.
2. Customer Satisfaction: Higher customer satisfaction scores are strongly correlated with policy renewals.
3. Policy Type: `Comprehensive` policies have the highest renewal rate and generate higher premiums.
4. Discounts: Offering discounts significantly improves renewal rates.
5. Demographics: High-income and married customers are more likely to renew their policies.

**Actionable Insights**
- Broker Strategy: Focus on high-value customers, offer tailored discounts, and improve engagement to boost renewal rates.
- Best Line of Business: Prioritize `Comprehensive` policies due to their high renewal rates and profitability.
- Customer Retention: Address customer needs proactively to improve satisfaction and retention.
